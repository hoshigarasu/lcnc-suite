"""HAL watchdog for webui-safety.

Loaded by LinuxCNC HAL config:  loadusr -W hal_watchdog.py
Listens for gateway heartbeat updates on a Unix socket.
When gateway disconnects, heartbeat stops toggling → downstream watchdog trips.
Pins survive gateway restart because this component is owned by LinuxCNC.
