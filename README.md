# LCNC Suite

A modern, UI-agnostic WebSocket gateway for LinuxCNC with a reference Vue 3 web interface.

## Overview

**lcnc-suite** provides a real-time WebSocket API for controlling and monitoring LinuxCNC machines. The architecture separates machine control (backend) from user interface (frontend), allowing you to build custom UIs for web, mobile, desktop, or embedded applications.

## Requirements

### Gateway
- LinuxCNC 2.8+ with Python bindings
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment with system-site-packages enabled

### Reference UI
- Node.js 18+ and npm

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lcnc-suite.git
cd lcnc-suite
```

### 2. Setup Gateway

```bash
cd lcnc-gateway
./setup-venv.sh  # Creates venv with system-site-packages for LinuxCNC
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Web UI (Optional)

```bash
cd ../lcnc-webui
npm install
```

## Quick Start

### Using the Launcher Script

The easiest way to run both services:

```bash
# Localhost only (default)
./restart.sh local

# Accessible from LAN
./restart.sh lan
```

The script will:
- Stop any existing instances
- Start the gateway on port 8000
- Start the web UI on port 5173
- Perform health checks
- Open your browser automatically

Logs are saved to `runlogs/`

### Manual Start

**Gateway:**
```bash
cd lcnc-gateway
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn gateway:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

**Web UI:**
```bash
cd lcnc-webui
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

### Client Commands

Send JSON messages to control the machine:

#### Arming
```json
{"cmd": "arm", "armed": true}
```

#### Heartbeat
Clients should send a heartbeat every 1 second. If the gateway doesn't receive a heartbeat from an armed client within 3 seconds, it will stop all motion and disarm the connection.
```json
{"cmd": "heartbeat"}
```

#### E-stop Control
```json
{"cmd": "estop"}
{"cmd": "estop_reset"}
```

#### Machine Power
```json
{"cmd": "machine_on"}
{"cmd": "machine_off"}
```

```json
{"cmd": "abort"}
```

#### MDI Commands
```json
{"cmd": "mdi", "text": "G0 X10 Y20"}
```

#### Auto Run
```json
{"cmd": "auto_run", "line": 0}
```

{"cmd": "jog_stop", "axis": 0}
{"cmd": "jog_cont_multi", "axes": [{"axis": 0, "vel": 70.7}, {"axis": 1, "vel": 70.7}]}
{"cmd": "jog_stop_multi", "axes": [0, 1]}
```

**Axis mapping**: 0=X, 1=Y, 2=Z, etc.

#### Homing & Mode
```json
{"cmd": "home_all"}
{"cmd": "unhome_all"}
{"cmd": "teleop_enable"}
{"cmd": "teleop_disable"}
```

```json
{"cmd": "set_feed_override", "scale": 1.0}
{"cmd": "set_spindle_override", "scale": 1.0}
{"cmd": "set_rapid_override", "scale": 1.0}
{"cmd": "set_max_velocity", "velocity": 100.0}
```

**Scale ranges**:
- Feed: 0.0-2.0 (0-200%)
- Spindle: 0.5-2.0 (50-200%)
- Rapid: 0.0-1.0 (0-100%)

### Error Handling

All commands return a reply:
```json
{
  "type": "reply",
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Cannot Machine On while in E-stop"
}
```

### Safety System

The gateway implements three layers of safety to handle connection loss during machine operation:

**Layer 1 — Disconnect Handler**: When an armed WebSocket client disconnects (browser closed, network drop), the gateway immediately sends `jog_stop` for all axes and `abort` to halt any running program.

**Layer 2 — Heartbeat Watchdog**: The client sends `{"cmd": "heartbeat"}` every 1 second. If the gateway doesn't receive a heartbeat from an armed client within 3 seconds (e.g., browser freeze, WiFi stall), it stops all motion and disarms the connection. The client receives an error message: `"Heartbeat timeout — disarmed for safety"`.

**Layer 3 — HAL Watchdog**: A standalone `hal_watchdog.py` component is loaded by LinuxCNC via the HAL config (not spawned by the gateway). It creates two HAL pins and listens on a Unix socket (`/tmp/webui-safety.sock`). The gateway connects to this socket as a client and sends pin updates.

| Pin | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `webui-safety.heartbeat` | BIT OUT | Toggles with each gateway heartbeat cycle |
| `webui-safety.connected` | BIT OUT | True when at least one armed client is connected |

Because the watchdog is owned by LinuxCNC, the HAL pins survive gateway restarts. If the gateway crashes or disconnects, the watchdog immediately forces both pins LOW, triggering e-stop through the safety chain.

#### Setting Up the HAL Watchdog

Add the following to your **POSTGUI_HALFILE** (runs after your main HAL config):

```hal
# 1. Load the watchdog component (owned by LinuxCNC)
loadusr -Wn webui-safety /path/to/lcnc-suite/lcnc-gateway/hal_watchdog.py

# 2. Create an AND gate for the e-stop chain
loadrt and2 count=1
addf and2.0 servo-thread

# 3. Break the existing e-stop loopback (adapt to your config)
#    For sim configs this is typically:
#      net estop-loop iocontrol.0.user-enable-out iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in
unlinkp iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in

# 4. Wire the AND gate: both conditions must be TRUE to leave e-stop
#    - Input 0: User has not pressed e-stop
#    - Input 1: An armed web client is connected
net estop-loop                    => and2.0.in0
net webui-connected webui-safety.connected => and2.0.in1
net estop-out and2.0.out          => iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in
```

**Notes for non-sim configs**: The `unlinkp` line must match whatever pin currently drives `iocontrol.0.emc-enable-in` in your setup. Check your existing HAL files to identify the current e-stop topology before inserting the AND gate.

**Startup order does not matter**: The gateway and LinuxCNC can start in any order. The gateway retries the watchdog socket connection automatically, and the watchdog defaults both pins to FALSE until the gateway connects and reports an armed client.

**Monitoring**: Use `halcmd` to inspect the safety pins at runtime:
```bash
halcmd show pin webui-safety
halcmd show sig webui-connected
halcmd show sig estop-out
```

## Building Your Own UI

The gateway is completely UI-agnostic. To build your own interface:

1. **Connect to WebSocket**: `ws://<gateway-host>:8000/ws`
2. **Receive `viewer_init`**: Get machine configuration
3. **Receive `status` messages**: Update your UI @ 10 Hz
4. **Send commands**: Control the machine via JSON messages
5. **Handle replies**: Process command responses and errors

Example minimal client:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);

  switch(msg.type) {
    case 'viewer_init':
      console.log('Machine config:', msg.data);
      break;
    case 'status':
      console.log('Position:', msg.data.work_pos);
      break;
    case 'reply':
      console.log('Command result:', msg.ok);
      break;
  }
};

// Arm the connection
ws.send(JSON.stringify({cmd: 'arm', armed: true}));

// Send MDI command
ws.send(JSON.stringify({cmd: 'mdi', text: 'G0 X10'}));
```

## Development

### Gateway Development

```bash
cd lcnc-gateway
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run with auto-reload
uvicorn gateway:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### UI Development

```bash
cd lcnc-webui
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server provides hot module replacement for rapid development.

## Configuration

### Machine Models

STL models are stored in `lcnc-gateway/machine/`:
- `frame.stl` - Machine base/frame
- `x_axis.stl` - X-axis assembly
- `y_axis.stl` - Y-axis assembly
- `z_axis.stl` - Z-axis assembly

Models are tracked with Git LFS (see `.gitattributes`).

### Kinematics

Edit the `build_viewer_init()` function in `gateway.py` to match your machine's kinematics and model transforms.

### Polling Rate

Adjust `POLL_HZ` in `gateway.py` (default: 10 Hz).
